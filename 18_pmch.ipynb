        "A **matching** in a **graph** G is a collection of **edges** of G for which no node belongs to more than one edge in the collection. If G contains an even number of nodes (say 2n), then a matching on G is **perfect** if it contains n edges, which is clearly the maximum possible.\n",

        "First, let Kn denote the **complete graph** on 2n labeled nodes, in which every **node** is connected to every other node with an edge, and let pn denote the total number of perfect matchings in Kn. For a given node x, there are 2n−1 ways to join x to the other nodes in the graph, after which point we must form a perfect matching on the remaining 2n−2 nodes. This reasoning provides us with the recurrence relation pn=(2n−1)⋅pn−1; using the fact that p1 is 1, this **recurrence relation** implies the closed equation pn=(2n−1)(2n−3)(2n−5)⋯(3)(1).\n",

Second, form all possible edges {A, U} and {C, G}, called **basepair edges**.\n",
